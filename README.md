# XboxGraphicalPatches
My personal collection of graphical IPS/BPS patches for Original Xbox games.

The graphical IPS/BPS patches mostly consist of 16:9 widescreen patches, 720p resolution patches, progressive scan (480p) patches, and 60 FPS patches. These IPS/BPS patches should be applied to the default.xbe Xbox executables with programs like Lunar IPS or FLIPS. They have only been tested to work on the USA versions, which means they may or may not work on other regional versions.

Keep in mind that most of the 720p patches are unstable and are generally not recommended to be used on emulators or on real hardware. Some 720p patches must be ran on modified Xbox systems with 128 MB of RAM for a somewhat stable user experience.
